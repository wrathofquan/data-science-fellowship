Ross’s Proposal 
Motivation - Why did elites extend the franchise? Previous work suggests that, in response to a threat of social violence, elites expand voting rights because they cannot credibly commit to sustained redistribution. Is the safety net an effective means of mitigating social violence? 
Context - During the American Civil War, the blockade of Southern ports led to a dramatic spike in raw cotton prices. Highly concentrated cotton spinning regions in England were devastated by the supply shock, resulting in local unemployment rates as high as 30%. In the depth of the recession, the Public Works (Cotton Manufacturing Districts) Act of 1863 provided loans for public works projects in cotton spinning regions to relieve unemployed workers.   
Proposal - Digitize parliamentary election results, poor law expenditures and receipts, and judicial statistics records via OCR. 
Methods - fOCR.
