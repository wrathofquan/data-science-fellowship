HELSTON [84] (Cont)

Electors Candidate Party Votes
1,063 W.N.M. St. Aubyn C 466
A.W. Young L 429

Void election

The candidates had polled 153 votes each but the Returning Officer (who had
voted for Campbell and was the father of Campbell's election agent) had given a
casting vote to the Liberal candidate. A petition was lodged and the Committee
decided that the Returning Officer had no right to a casting vote and should have
returned both candidates. On scrutiny one vote was struck off Campbell’s total
and his election declared void. Brett declared duly elected. As a result of this case
the House of Commons (July 26, 1866) resolved "that according to the law and
usage of Parliament it is the duty of the sheriff or other returning officer in
England, in the case of an equal number of votes being polled for two or more
candidates at an election, to return all such candidates". The House decided to
take no action against the Returning Officer who was the 75-year-old Mayor of
Helston and said to be in poor health. He had failed to appear before the Com-
mittee hearing the petition but subsequently wrote to the Speaker claiming
that he had consulted a legal textbook which indicated that he could give a
casting vote.
