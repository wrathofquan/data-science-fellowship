Note:-

       1838:   During the hearing of the 1837 election petition, a compromise was reached between
               the Liberal and Conservative   parties. lt was agreed that at the end of the Parliamen
               tary session Wilshere should resign and allow Baring to be elected without opposition.
               Although Wilshere did keep to the agreement and resigned, his supporters nominated
               him without his consent (he was abroad at the time) and he was re elected.
