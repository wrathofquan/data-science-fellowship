                        bribery and as a result the borough lost its right to return a Member of Parliament

                        29, 1844.

         1834:          Lapsed on Dissolution of Parliament. (The candidates had polled 263 votes each
                        but the Returning Officer had given a casting vote to Barnes. A similar case arose at
                        Helston in 1866 and as a result the House of Commons resolved that the Returning
                        Officer did not have the right of a casting vote and it was his duty to return all can
                        didates who polled equal votes).
