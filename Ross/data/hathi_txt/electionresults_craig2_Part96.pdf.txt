Petitions   :-
         1847:   Withdrawn
         1880:   Withdrawn (Willis only). As the result of a recount there were found to be 1,641 un
                 disputed votes for Learmonth and 1,640 for Willis. Twenty-three ballot papers were
                 reserved for Judgement on scrutiny but the Conservatives      decided to withdraw the
                 petition giving as their reason the costs lnvolved. lt would seem more likely that the
                 real reason was that they considered that Willis was certain to maintain or lncrease his
                 majority over Learmonth after the disputed ballot-papers had been dealt with.
