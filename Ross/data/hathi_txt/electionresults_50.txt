Note: â€”
    1841:      Leicester claimed  to be the eldest son of the third Marquess of Townshend but in
               1843  it was proved that he was an illegitimate son and not entitled to use the
               courtesy title of Earl of Leicester. For a short time he reverted to his real name of
               John Townshend but subsequently changed this by Royal License to John Dunn
               Gardner.
