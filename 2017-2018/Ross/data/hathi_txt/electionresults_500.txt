Double return. The poll books for two polling stations at Aberystwyth had been lost
or stolen in transit to the Returning Officer who decided that in the circumstances lt
was best to return both candidates. The Committee accepted evidence that the polling
at Aberystwyth had resulted Pryse 142 and Harford 59 making the totals, Pryse 305
and Harford 285. They declared the election of Harford void and found that Pryse
was duly elected (Harford only).
