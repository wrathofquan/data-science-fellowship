                   Writ suspended.   Royal Commission appointed which found proof of extensive
                   bribery and as a result the borough lost its right to return a Member of Parliament
                   and was incorporated into the county constituency of Devon, Southern, from the
                   Dissolution.
Petitions:
  1839:            Double return. The election was declared void on a technicality â€” the Returning
                   Officer having failed to give proper notice of the poll
  1852:            Dismissed   (Mills only)
  1857:            Withdrawn
  1865:            Election of Pender declared       void. Petition against Seymour dismissed
