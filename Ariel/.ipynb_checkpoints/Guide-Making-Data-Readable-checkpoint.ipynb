    "When you encounter data that is not stored in the format that you need it in don't panic because you can use methods such as string slicing, list comprehension, and type conversion to store the data in a way that you prefer!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips\n",
    "- try to write code in a very general way so that your program works for all your data points\n",
    "- look for patterns in your data entries that make it possible to break up your data in a consistent way\n",
    "- use lots of print statements to check that your output is what you expected\n",
    "- always check the type of the data you have and compare it to the type of data you want\n",
    "    - *note: even if a column looks like it contains numbers, each entry could be a string instead of an integer*\n",
