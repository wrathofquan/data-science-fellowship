# Library Data Science Fellowship

## The high-level goals for this project

- To share with other library fellows + staff, what goes into _doing_ data science aside from the visualizations and algorithms

- To illustrate the process and components of a data science project (creating research questions, infrastructure, choosing techology, etc.)

- To show how data science is not simply statistics + CS but a dynamic field that works across domains, is creative, and solves real-world problems


## The Practical things we can try to accomplish with the Water Data

- Illustrate how this relationship was formed (Through Division/West Big Data Hub, local municipalities, etc.)

- Share how problems are articulated and framed and what kind of critical thinking went into approaching the problem

- Create static visualizations

- Provide a vision for future work


## Parking Lot for other ideas
